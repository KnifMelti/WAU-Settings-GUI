# WAU Settings GUI (for Winget-AutoUpdate)
Provides a user-friendly interface to modify every aspect of Winget-AutoUpdate settings

Significantly enhance WAU's usability for home users while maintaining enterprise-grade functionality.<br>
Benefits from not having to manage the settings in several places when testing etc. (perfect for developers)...

...a perfect companion for those supporting the community being able to ask for a screenshot of the settings because it now has everything in it (even a screenshot function)!
