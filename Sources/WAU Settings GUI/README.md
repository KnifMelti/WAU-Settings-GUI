# Manual installation
- Extract `Sources\WAU Settings GUI` (`Install.cmd`, `WAU-Settings-GUI.ps1` and `config`) to wherever you want to run **WAU Settings GUI** from
- Don't place them in the **WAU** installation directory, as this will be overwritten on updates.
- Run `Install.cmd`
  - Toggle the **☐|☑ Start Menu shortcuts** option in the GUI and `Save Settings`
  - Retoggle **☑|☐** and `Save Settings` again (depending on your choice)
- The **WAU Settings (Administrator)** shortcut has now been created under **Start Menu\Programs\Winget-AutoUpdate** folder (along with the other **WAU** shortcuts) or on your own **Desktop**.
