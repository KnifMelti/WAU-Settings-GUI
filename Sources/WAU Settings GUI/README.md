# Manual installation
- Extract `Install.cmd`, `WAU-Settings-GUI.ps1` and `config` to wherever you want to install **WAU Settings GUI**
- Don't place them in the **WAU** installation directory, as this will be overwritten on updates.
- Run `Install.cmd`
  - Toggle the 'Start Menu shortcuts' option in the GUI and save settings
  - Retoggle it and save settings again (depending on your choice)
- The 'WAU Settings GUI' shortcut is now created in Start Menu under 'Winget-AutoUpdate' folder or on your own desktop.
- This first release uses the [2.5.2](https://github.com/Romanitho/Winget-AutoUpdate/releases/tag/v2.5.2) version of **WAU GUID path** for the icon
